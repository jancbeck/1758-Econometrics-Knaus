## 3 Data Analysis

### 3.1

```{r, echo=FALSE}

price <- chick$pchick
demand <- chick$consum

plot(x = price,
     y = demand,
     xlab="Price", #Beschriftung x-Achse
     ylab="Demand", #Beschriftung y-Achase
     main="Scatterplot") #Beschriftung Grafik
     #abline(lm(y~x), col="red"), #regression line (y~x)
     #lines(lowess(x,y), col="blue")) # lowess line (x,y)

```
We observe a __positive__ relationship between price of chicken and demand for chicken. This is contrary to the fundamental economic principle of *law of demand* which states that "conditional on all else being equal, as the price of a good increases (↑), quantity demanded will decrease (↓); conversely, as the price of a good decreases (↓), quantity demanded will increase (↑)" (Nicholson, Snyder, 2012). In other words, we would expect to see a negative relationship.

### 3.2 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
model1 <- lm(log(consum) ~ log(income) + log(pchick) + log(pbeef) + log(ppork), data=chick) # attention logs!
#summary(model1)

m1_B0 <- as.vector(coef(model1)[1]) # intercept
m1_B1 <- as.vector(coef(model1)[2]) # beta1hat income
m1_B2 <- as.vector(coef(model1)[3]) # beta2hat chicken
m1_B3 <- as.vector(coef(model1)[4]) # beta3hat beef
m1_B4 <- as.vector(coef(model1)[5]) # beta4hat pork

```

```{r, results='asis', echo=FALSE}
invisible(stargazer(model1, header=FALSE, type='latex', title="Model 1 regression results", align=TRUE))

```

The result suggests that if we hold all else equal, the higher the price for chicken the lower demand for it (__negative__ correlation). This is compatible with what economic theory suggests. 

We might consider a log-log model so that we can interpret the coefficients as elasticities (percentage changes).  Ceteris paribus a one percent increase in the price of chicken leads to a __`r m1_B2`__%% decrease in demand for chicken.


### 3.3

According to the model we expect a 1% increase of income leads to a __`r m1_B1`__% change in demand ceteris paribus.


### 3.4

According to the model we expect that a 2% increase of income leads to a __`r 2*m1_B1`__% change in demand ceteris paribus.


### 3.5

```{r, echo=FALSE}

log_demand <- predict(model1, data.frame(income=2200, pchick=50, ppork=170, pbeef=312)) 


```

The model predicts a log demand of chicken of __`r log_demand`__ (or __`r exp(log_demand)`__  non-logged).

### 3.6

```{r, echo=FALSE}

N <- nrow(chick)
fitted <- fitted(model1)
r <- cov(fitted, log(demand)) / (sd(fitted) * sd(log(demand)))
#cor(fitted, log(demand))
                                 
SSR <- sum((log(demand) - fitted )^2) # or: sum(resid(model1)^2)
#SSR == sum(resid(model1)^2) # should be the same
TSS <- sum((log(demand) - mean(log(demand)))^2)
#TSS == var(log(demand)) * ( N - 1) # equals alternate formula: N * var(Y) 

r2 <- 1 - SSR/TSS
#r2 == summary(model1)$r.squared  # compare our result with regression output
 
```

To obtain the sample correlation $\mathrm{r}$ we compute according to the formula

$$
r_{x y}=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(x_{i}-\bar{x}\right)\left(y_{i}-\bar{y}\right)}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(x_{i}-\bar{x}\right)^{2}} \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(y_{i}-\bar{y}\right)^{2}}} = \frac{Cov(X,Y)}{\sqrt{Var(X)  Var(Y)}}
$$
and get __`r r`__.

To obtain the coefficient of determination $\mathrm{R}^{2}$ we compute according to the formula 

$$
\mathrm{R}^{2}=\frac{\mathrm{TSS}-\mathrm{SSR}}{\mathrm{TSS}}=1-\frac{\mathrm{SSR}}{\mathrm{TSS}}
$$
where

$$
\mathrm{SSR}=\sum_{i=1}^{N} \hat{u}_{i}^{2} \quad \text{ and } \quad \mathrm{TSS}=\sum_{i=1}^{N}\left(y_{i}-\bar{y}\right)^{2}
$$

and get __`r r2`__

### 3.7

#### i)
```{r, echo=FALSE}

biased_residVar <- SSR / N # sum of squared residuals / N-1 
#biased_residVar == var(resid(model1)) # should be the same

```

To obtain a biased estimator of the variance of the residuals we compute according to the naive formula 

$$
\tilde{\hat{\sigma}}^{2}=\frac{\mathrm{SSR}}{\mathrm{N}}
$$

and get __`r format(round(biased_residVar, 11), nsmall = 11)`__

#### ii)

```{r, echo=FALSE}

K <- length( model1$coefficients ) - 1 # number of predictor variables X1, . . . , XK.
unbiased_residVar <- SSR / ( N - K - 1 ) # SSR/(N-K-1)

```

To compute the unbiased estimator of the error variance $\hat\sigma^2$ we compute according to the formula 

$$
\begin{aligned}
\hat{\sigma}^{2} = \frac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^n \hat{u}_{i}^{2}}{(n - k - 1)} = \frac{SSR}{df}
\end{aligned}
$$

and get __`r format(round(unbiased_residVar, 11), nsmall = 11)`__ 

#### iii) 

```{r, results='asis', echo=FALSE}

invisible(stargazer(vcov(model1), header=FALSE, align=TRUE, digits=4, column.sep.width="0pt", title="Model 1 Covariance Matrix", table.placement="b"))

```

### 3.8

```{r, echo=FALSE}

model2 <- lm(log(consum) ~ log(income), data=chick)
#summary(model2)
m2_B1 <- as.vector(coef(model2)[2]) # alpha1
m2_r2 <- summary(model2)$r.squared

model3 <- lm(log(consum) ~ log(pchick), data=chick)
#summary(model3)
m3_B1 <- as.vector(coef(model3)[2]) # alpha2
m3_r2 <- summary(model3)$r.squared

```

```{r, results='asis', echo=FALSE}

invisible(stargazer(model1, model2, model3, header=FALSE, align=TRUE, digits=7, title="Model comparison", omit.stat=c("f")))

```

The estimated coefficient in model 1 $\hat{\beta}_{1}$ is __`r m1_B1`__ compared to __`r m2_B1`__ of $\hat{\alpha}_{1}$ in model 2.

The estimated coefficient in model 1 $\hat{\beta}_{2}$ is __`r m1_B2`__ compared to __`r m3_B1`__ of $\hat{\alpha}_{2}$ in model 3. 

The reason for the difference in log(income) could be that in model 1 we have other variables that we hold equal when we change $\hat{\beta}_{1}$. However, in model 2 and 3 we only have one predictor variable so less is explained by our model (the $R^2_2$ is __`r m2_r2`__ and $R^2_2$ is __`r m3_r2`__) and we have larger error terms. As a result the effects of the coefficients change since they are not isolated. 

An economic interpretation would be that higher prices of meat are strongly correlated and that they are highly substitutable. Therefore, if the prices of all meats increase, consumers buy the cheapest one which is chicken. This could explain why we see a higher demand for chicken even if the price of chicken increases. Once we control for the prices of other meats, the relationship no longer holds.

## 4 Theory

### 4.1 

#### i)

By definition study+sleep+work+leisure=168. Therefore, if we change study we also need to change at least one of the other categories so that they still sum up to 168.

#### ii)

This model violates MLR.3 (No Perfect Collinearity). There is a perfect linearity between study, sleep, work and leisure, since study+sleep+work+leisure= 168, so these variables exhibit perfect multicollinearity. To not violate assumption MLR.3, we have to drop one of the independent variables, so that: <br />
$GPA= \beta_1+ \beta_1study+ \beta_2sleep + \beta_3 work +u.$ Now, if we increase e.g study by 1, $\beta_1$ is the change in GPA, when we we increase study by 1 hour, but hold sleep and work constant. 


### 4.2

To answer this question we look at the components of the equation that define the standard error of the OLS estimators of the coefficient $\tilde{\beta}_{1}$ and $\hat{\beta}_{j}$ for the simple and multiple regression model respectively:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\operatorname{se}(\tilde{\beta}_{1})&=\frac{\hat{\sigma}}{\sqrt{n} \operatorname{sd}(x_{j}) } \\ \\
\operatorname{se}(\hat{\beta}_{j})&=\frac{\hat{\sigma}}{\sqrt{n} \operatorname{sd}(x_{j}) \sqrt{1-R_{j}^{2}}}
\end{aligned}
$$

We see that given the same sample and error variance $\sigma^{2}$, the variance of the OLS estimators of the coefficient in the multiple regression model can only ever be equal or larger than that of the simple regression model because of $1-R_{j}^{2}$. 
"$x_{1}$ is almost uncorrelated" implies a value for $R_{j}^{2}$ that is close to zero. 

Next, we estimate the error variance $\hat{\sigma}^{2}$ by dividing the sum of squared residuals (SSR) by the degrees of freedom (df):

$$
\begin{aligned}
\hat{\sigma}^{2} = \frac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^n \hat{u}_{i}^{2}}{(n - k - 1)} = \frac{\mathrm{SSR}}{\mathrm{df}}
\end{aligned}
$$

In the case of the simple regression k=1, therefore in the multiple regression model the denominator has to be smaller and is increasing the error variance (and in turn, standard error). However, this effect tends to become smaller the larger our N. This only leaves SSR (larger sum of squared residuals) as a cause for a difference between $\tilde{\beta}_{1}$ and $\hat{\beta}_{j}$.  

We know that the OLS residuals are defined by

$$
\hat{u}_{i}=y_{i}-\hat{\beta}_{0}-\hat{\beta}_{1} x_{i 1}-\hat{\beta}_{2} x_{i 2}-\ldots-\hat{\beta}_{k} x_{i k}
$$

Therefore, given that "$x_2$ and $x_3$ have large partial effects on *y*" and assuming that all coefficients have a positive sign, $\hat{u}_{i}$ will be smaller in the model that includes more variables, which is $\hat{\beta}_{j}$.
